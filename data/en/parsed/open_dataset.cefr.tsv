The reason why is something called the division and specialization of labor , a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith , -LSB- link -RSB- , in his book , The Wealth of Nations . 	division	distribution	dividing
Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way . 	comprehensive	full	complete	thorough	broad	widespread
In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person . 	division	distribution	dividing
To illustrate the division of labor , Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin : drawing out a piece of wire , cutting it to the right length , straightening it , putting a head on one end and a point on the other , and packaging pins for sale , to name just a few . 	illustrate	represent	explain	demonstrate

Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides up the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef , sous chefs , less-skilled kitchen help , servers to wait on the tables , a greeter at the door , janitors to clean up , and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills-not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food , furniture , kitchen equipment , and the building where it is located . 	janitor	attendant

When the tasks involved with producing a good or service are divided and subdivided , workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output . 	output	product
First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage . 	particular	singular	single	individual
-LRB- In later chapters , we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage . -RRB- 	later	following
The particular advantages may be based on educational choices , which are in turn shaped by interests and talents . 	particular	precise

In fact , specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better . 	innovative	new	inventive	original	creative
Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale , which means that for many goods , as the level of production increases , the average cost of producing each individual unit declines . 	decline	fall	decrease
However , if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year , then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks , and the average cost of production per car will be lower . 	assembly	construction
